Screenshots:

- Here's a screenshot of the output. There is only 1 minor bug, in that the terminal doesn't really take in the first input the user gives, so the user is required to repeat their input at the first prompt. This behavior is not present the second time the user is prompted, so this is puzzling behavior.
